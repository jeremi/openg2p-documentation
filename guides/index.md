“OpenG2P” aims to provide a confluence for and solutions to effectively digitize government to persons, and large-scale social protection transfers. It is a set of digital building blocks helping SPs digitize key cogs & address gaps in the delivery chain of targeting & enrollment, list management, payment digitization, & recourse.

The minimum operational functions that should be
supported by an effective MIS in a social protection scheme
are:

- Application and registration;
- Enrollment of beneficiaries;
- Monitoring of compliance with conditions (if applicable);
- Production of lists of those who should receive payments
and the level of payment to be given;
- Identification of those recipients who have been paid and
those who have not, for payment reconciliation;
- Management and monitoring of the Grievance
mechanism;
- Identification of those who should be removed from
a program when no longer eligible or deceased;
- Notification of when different processes have happened
or should happen (e.g. when a payment is due or when
recipients should exit a scheme); and
- Provision of reports to be used for management and
monitoring
