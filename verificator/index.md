The core design issue is how to manage the tradeoff between Type-II errors of inclusion whereby benefits
are paid to non-eligible or “ghost” recipients against Type-I errors of exclusion whereby legitimate
beneficiaries are denied benefits to which they are entitled.

This question is particularly salient in developing countries. Historically, states have invested
in the ability to better identify their citizens as they develop (Scott, 1998).
